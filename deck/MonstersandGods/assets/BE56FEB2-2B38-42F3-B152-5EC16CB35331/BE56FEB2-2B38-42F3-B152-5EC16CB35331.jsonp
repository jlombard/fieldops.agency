This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent \"givers.\" As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type.","targetRectangle":{"y":1674.866587293822,"x":2.000013470649719,"width":1014.588,"height":283.9839985389699}},{"text":"Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, INFJs may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil.

For instance, there can sometimes be a \"tug-of-war\" between NF vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals.

Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields.
