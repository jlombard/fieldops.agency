My name is Marcus.  I'm working towards the same goal as you but have gone off the radar.  I fear that our handlers may be corrupt. <br/>

I know this is concerning and won't ask for anything of you but I will send you intel that you can use to uncover the truth.  <br/>

Rosey is turning 40 this year and to celebrate we have created an immersive story of intrigue and mystery that will unfold over a period of thirty days.   It’ll start with a slow trickle of clues that reveal the story and ensnare her in the plot.  All the threads of the story will come together at a surprise party at [tbd] on [4/28] at 4pm.   We would love it if you could attend.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to play a bigger role in this story, we could use your help.<br/>

Clicking symbols reveals a form…  for all but the symbol that resembles a rothco painting, the form leads to a deadend.   When the starting point is the rothco painting, a lock appears.  <br/>

For the wrong symbols use the url structure S3CUR3DL1N3.COM/w/######<br/>
Most of these will lead to a standard 404 page. Some will lead to a false start just to tease / hint players.<br/>

The spies are still patriots and help you with the mission. <br/>

Twist, you aren't sure if the spies are traitors or not.   <br/>

There are two endings.  If you choose to accept the help of the spies and if you don't. <br/>

Both positive for the hero but this gives the hero a sense of control in the story. <br/>
