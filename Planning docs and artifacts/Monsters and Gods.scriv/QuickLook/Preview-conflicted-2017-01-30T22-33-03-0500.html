Rosey is turning 40 this year and to celebrate we have created an immersive story of intrigue and mystery that will unfold over a period of thirty days.   It’ll start with a slow trickle of clues that reveal the story and ensnare her in the plot.  All the threads of the story will come together at a surprise party at [tbd] on [4/28] at 4pm.   We would love it if you could attend.<br/>
